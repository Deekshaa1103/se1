Creating a Class Diagram in StarUML is straightforward once you know the steps. Here's a clear, quick guide you can follow:
________________________________________
⭐ How to Create a Class Diagram in StarUML
1. Create/Open a Project
•	Launch StarUML
•	Go to File → New (or open an existing project)
2. Add a Class Diagram
•	In the Model Explorer (left panel):
o	Right-click on the Model
o	Select Add Diagram → UML → Class Diagram
A blank class diagram canvas will appear.
________________________________________
⭐ 3. Add Classes
•	Go to the Toolbox (right side)
•	Under UML Structural, select Class
•	Click anywhere on the canvas to place the class
Rename the class:
•	Double-click the class name and type (e.g., Student)
Add attributes and methods:
•	Double-click inside the class, then type:
o	Attributes (e.g., -name: String)
o	Operations/methods (e.g., +getName(): String)
________________________________________
⭐ 4. Add Relationships
In the Toolbox, choose the relationship type:
Association
•	Solid line between two classes
•	Use for general links (e.g., Person — Owns — Car)
Multiplicity
•	Click a line end → set multiplicity in the properties (e.g., 1..*, 0..1)
Generalization (Inheritance)
•	Arrow with hollow triangle (Child → Parent)
Aggregation
•	Hollow diamond (Whole → Part)
Composition
•	Filled diamond (Strong Whole → Part)
Dependency
•	Dashed line
Click the tool → click class A → click class B to connect.
________________________________________
⭐ 5. Arrange and Format
•	Drag classes to clean up layout
•	Use Auto Layout (if available)
•	Customize colors in the Properties panel
________________________________________
⭐ 6. Save or Export
•	Save: File → Save
•	Export image: File → Export Diagram as JPG/PNG/SVG/PDF

Here is a clear, simple guide to creating a Use Case Diagram in StarUML, similar to the class-diagram instructions you asked for earlier.
________________________________________
⭐ How to Create a Use Case Diagram in StarUML
1. Create or Open a Project
•	Open StarUML
•	Go to File → New (or open an existing project)
________________________________________
⭐ 2. Add a Use Case Diagram
•	In the Model Explorer (left side):
o	Right-click Model
o	Select Add Diagram → UML → Use Case Diagram
A blank use case diagram canvas will appear.
________________________________________
⭐ 3. Add Actors
•	From the Toolbox (right side):
o	Under UML Behavioral, select Actor
o	Click on the diagram to place the actor symbol
Rename the actor:
•	Double-click the actor name (e.g., Customer, Admin)
________________________________________
⭐ 4. Add Use Cases
•	In the Toolbox, choose Use Case
•	Click on the diagram to place it
Rename:
•	Double-click the oval name (e.g., Login, Place Order, Register)
________________________________________
⭐ 5. Add Relationships
Association (Actor ↔ Use Case)
•	In the Toolbox, select Association
•	Click the actor → click the use case
(creates a straight line showing interaction)
Include Relationship
•	Used when a use case always includes another (shared behavior)
•	Toolbox → Include
•	Click the base use case → required use case
(arrow with <<include>>)
Extend Relationship
•	Used when a use case optionally adds behavior
•	Toolbox → Extend
•	Click the extending use case → base use case
(arrow with <<extend>>)
Generalization
•	Actors or use cases can have inheritance
•	Toolbox → Generalization
•	Click child → parent
(e.g., Registered User → User)
________________________________________
⭐ 6. Organize and Format
•	Drag actors and use cases into position
•	Group related use cases visually
•	Adjust line anchors for clarity
________________________________________
⭐ 7. Save or Export
•	File → Save
•	File → Export Diagram as PNG/JPG/SVG/PDF
